# WoWAntiAFK
An **attempt** at keeping you from disconnecting from game World of Warcraft Classic.

It works by disconnecting your character, waiting for a minute and reconnecting you again every time a random amount of time between 5 and 20 minutes passes. This *should* only work in Windows.

## Instructions

<ol>
    <li>Have your character logged in and ready to go afk. You need your chat's message box (where you type in your messages) to be <b>clear</b>.</li>
    <li>Open the console app.</li>
    <li>Pray that you don't get randomly disconnected from the server.</li>
    <li>Once you are ready to play again, simply close the console. You can also close the game and the console will eventually stop running.</li>
</ol>

This will fail if:
<ul>
    <li>Your game crashes.</li>
    <li>You get randomly disconnected.</li>
    <li>It takes longer than a minute for your character to disconnect and reconnect again.</li>
</ul>

## To do
<ol>
    <li>Let you choose how much time to wait in between every cycle.</li>
    <li>Let you choose how much time to wait in between loading screens (disconnecting and reconnecting).</li>
    <li>Make this less sketchy lol. <small><-- This won't happen</small></li>
</ol>
